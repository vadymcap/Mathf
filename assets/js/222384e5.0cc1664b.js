affects level progression curve.\\nHigher values make leveling slower, lower values make it faster.\\n\\n**Usage Notes:**\\n- Default factor is 200\\n- Must be positive number\\n- Affects all level

current level (for progress bars).\\nReturns how much XP you\'ve earned in current level and how much is needed total.\\n\\n**Usage Notes:**\\n- Perfect for progress bars: achieved/total gives you 0.0-1.0 percentage\\n- Returns (1, 1) if experience is infinite\\n- Both return values are always positive\\n- achieved will never exceed total\\n\\n**Example:**\\n```lua\\nlocal achieved, total =
