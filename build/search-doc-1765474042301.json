Higher values make leveling slower, lower values make it faster. Usage Notes: Default factor is 200 Must be positive number Affects all level calculations globally Change this before performing any calculations for consistency Example: ExperienceCalculator.SetExperienceFactor(150) -- Faster progression ExperienceCalculator.SetExperienceFactor(300) -- Slower progression   ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"GetExperienceFactor​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ExperienceCalculator","url":"/Mathf/api/ExperienceCalculator#GetExperienceFactor","content":"&lt;/&gt; ExperienceCalculator.GetExperienceFactor() → number-- The current experience factor Gets the current experience scaling factor.

Usage Notes: Returns floor value (always rounds down) Works with any positive experience value Level 1 starts at 0 experience Safe to call with math.huge (returns maximum level) Example: local level = ExperienceCalculator.GetLevel(1000) print(&quot;Player is level:&quot;, level) -- e.g., 5   ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"GetExperienceRequiredForNextLevel​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ExperienceCalculator","url":"/Mathf/api/ExperienceCalculator#GetExperienceRequiredForNextLevel","content":"&lt;/&gt; ExperienceCalculator.GetExperienceRequiredForNextLevel( currentLevel: number-- The player's current level ) → number-- Total experience required to reach the next level Returns the total experience required to reach the next level from current level. Usage Notes: Input is the CURRENT level, not experience Result is the TOTAL experience needed for next level (not remaining) Use GetExperienceForNextLevel() to get remaining XP needed Example: local xpForLevel6 = ExperienceCalculator.GetExperienceRequiredForNextLevel(5) print(&quot;Total XP needed for level 6:&quot;, xpForLevel6)   ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"GetExperienceRequiredForLevel​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ExperienceCalculator","url":"/Mathf/api/ExperienceCalculator#GetExperienceRequiredForLevel","content":"&lt;/&gt; ExperienceCalculator.GetExperienceRequiredForLevel( level: number-- The target level ) → number-- Total experience required to reach that level Gets the total experience required to reach a specific level. Usage Notes: Input is the TARGET level you want to calculate for Returns cumulative XP needed from level 0 Useful for displaying level requirements in UI Example: local xpForLevel10 = ExperienceCalculator.GetExperienceRequiredForLevel(10) print(&quot;Total XP to reach level 10:&quot;, xpForLevel10)   ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"GetExperienceForNextLevel​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ExperienceCalculator","url":"/Mathf/api/ExperienceCalculator#GetExperienceForNextLevel","content":"&lt;/&gt; ExperienceCalculator.GetExperienceForNextLevel( currentExperience: number-- Player's current total experience ) → number-- Experience points remaining to reach next level Calculates how much more experience is needed to reach the next level. Usage Notes: Input is CURRENT experience, not level Returns remaining XP needed (not total required) Returns 0 if experience is infinite (math.huge) Useful for progress bars and &quot;XP to next level&quot; displays Example: local remaining = ExperienceCalculator.GetExperienceForNextLevel(1250) print(&quot;XP needed for next level:&quot;, remaining)   ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"GetSubExperience​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ExperienceCalculator","url":"/Mathf/api/ExperienceCalculator#GetSubExperience","content":"&lt;/&gt; ExperienceCalculator.GetSubExperience( currentExperience: number-- Player's current total experience ) → ( number,-- Experience achieved within current level number-- Total experience required for current level ) Calculates progress within the current level (for progress bars). Returns how much XP you've earned in current level and how much is needed total. Usage Notes: Perfect for progress bars: achieved/total gives you 0.0-1.0 percentage Returns (1, 1) if experience is infinite Both return values are always positive achieved will never exceed total Example: local achieved, total = ExperienceCalculator.GetSubExperience(1250) local percentage = achieved / total print(string.format(&quot;Level progress: %.1f%%&quot;, percentage * 100))   ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"GetExperienceBetweenLevels​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ExperienceCalculator","url":"/Mathf/api/ExperienceCalculator#GetExperienceBetweenLevels","content":"&lt;/&gt; ExperienceCalculator.GetExperienceBetweenLevels( fromLevel: number,-- Starting level toLevel: number-- Target level ) → number-- Experience difference between the two levels Calculates the experience difference between two levels. Useful for determining XP rewards or level gaps. Usage Notes: Can calculate forwards (level 5 to 10) or backwards (level 10 to 5) Returns absolute difference Useful for milestone rewards and catch-up mechanics Example: local xpGap = ExperienceCalculator.GetExperienceBetweenLevels(5, 10) print(&quot;XP needed to go from level 5 to 10:&quot;, xpGap)   ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"ProjectLevel​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ExperienceCalculator","url":"/Mathf/api/ExperienceCalculator#ProjectLevel","content":"&lt;/&gt; ExperienceCalculator.ProjectLevel( currentExperience: number,-- Current total experience experienceGain: number-- Experience to be added ) → number-- Projected level after gaining experience Calculates what level a player would reach after gaining specified experience. Usage Notes: Does not modify current experience, only projects the result Useful for &quot;what if&quot; calculations and reward previews Handles overflow safely Example: local futureLevel = ExperienceCalculator.ProjectLevel(1000, 500) print(&quot;After gaining 500 XP, you'll be level:&quot;, futureLevel)   ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"GetLevelProgressPercentage​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ExperienceCalculator","url":"/Mathf/api/ExperienceCalculator#GetLevelProgressPercentage","content":"&lt;/&gt; ExperienceCalculator.GetLevelProgressPercentage( currentExperience: number-- Player's current total experience ) → number-- Completion percentage (0-100) Calculates completion percentage of current level (0-100). Convenience function that combines GetSubExperience with percentage calculation. Usage Notes: Returns value between 0 and 100 Useful for UI displays without manual calculation Returns 100 if experience is infinite Example: local percent = ExperienceCalculator.GetLevelProgressPercentage(1250) print(string.format(&quot;Level progress: %.1f%%&quot;, percent))   ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"WillLevelUp​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ExperienceCalculator","url":"/Mathf/api/ExperienceCalculator#WillLevelUp","content":"&lt;/&gt; ExperienceCalculator.WillLevelUp( currentExperience: number,-- Experience before gain newExperience: number-- Experience after gain ) → boolean-- True if the experience gain causes a level up Validates if an experience value would cause a level up. Usage Notes: Useful for triggering level-up events and animations Check this before and after adding experience Returns false if either value is infinite Example: local oldXP = 1000 local newXP = 1500 if ExperienceCalculator.WillLevelUp(oldXP, newXP) then print(&quot;Level up!&quot;) end   ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"GenerateLevelTable​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ExperienceCalculator","url":"/Mathf/api/ExperienceCalculator#GenerateLevelTable","content":"&lt;/&gt; ExperienceCalculator.GenerateLevelTable( startLevel: number,-- First level in the table endLevel: number-- Last level in the table ) → table-- Dictionary mapping levels to experience requirements Generates a lookup table of experience requirements for a range of levels. Useful for caching and displaying level progression tables. Usage Notes: Computationally efficient for displaying multiple level requirements Returns a dictionary with level as key, XP as value Useful for leaderboards and progression UI Example: local table = ExperienceCalculator.GenerateLevelTable(1, 20) for level, xp in pairs(table) do print(string.format(&quot;Level %d: %d XP&quot;, level, xp)) end  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"}],"options":{"id":"default"}}
